## About

**statcan-geographies-search** is a Cloudflare worker that allows searching of Statistics Canada's geographies and makes use of SQLite's full-text search [(FTS5)](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) extension.

You can preview this Cloudflare worker by going to https://geographies.sisyphus.ca/ . After searching, you can click on the DGUID, and it will open up a map page, zooming to the geography.

## Steps to Deploy

```shell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/diegoripley/statcan-geographies-search.git
# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd statcan-geographies-search
# 3. Install the JavaScript dependencies

# 3. Make sure you are logged in with wrangler
npx wrangler login
# 3. Create a Cloudflare D1 database, add the database_id to wrangler.toml
npx wrangler d1 create geographies_search
# 4. Create an R2 bucket, this will host the GeoJSON geometries for Statistics Canada's geographies. Change the bucket_name value in wrangler.tom if it's different than above
npx wrangler r2 bucket create geographies-search
# 6. Import the geographies SQL into D1. If you want to generate it yourself head into the notebooks folder for instructions. You will need to run the notebook to generate the GeoJSON files
npx wrangler d1 execute geographies_search --remote --file=db/geographies.sql
# 7. If you want to generate the dist/output.css
